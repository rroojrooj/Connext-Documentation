- With the concept of "Trustlessness", Connext implements Router to make no one rely on person or people. They do not need to trust anyone which might be the safe way to move the asset from one chain to another. 
Therefore, the main major reason is "Truslessness" and its strong security”. It is also undeniable that routers helps provide liquidity on destination chain, which can help to increase the efficiency of Connext.t.

- Now, Let’s talk about router after the Amarok upgrade, in which this change can be considered as one of the important step and make Routers even more important and a must than before to Connext.
With Amarok Upgrade and a close partnership with Nomad, Modular Interoperability has been introduced which help Connext move closer to the ideal outcome by modularizing the protocol stack 
(Ref :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnw6x_v0iiY&t=80s). 

- How Amarok Upgrade helps Router to operate in a more efficient and effective way?
There are 2 changes that help to enhance the operation of Router which are:
--1). 1-of-N-Routing : The user’s transaction can be completed by any routers themselves, unlike before the Amarok Upgrade, routers need to available 24/7 during a transaction; otherwise, the user’s fund can be locked;
therefore, this can help to remove the possibility of user fun lockups as well as significantly reduce the liveness requirements for routers.
--2). Simpler Liquidity : Routers can receive liquidity in the destination chain of a transaction directly where they provide it. This can massively create and improve more capital efficiency and availability as well as 
eliminate the possibility of liquidity rebalancing and fragmentation. 
Therefore, with the Amarok Upgrade, it enables a much better flow and improve security as well.

- There are a lot of cases that they implement node validator(People who hold the liquidity and are the one who approve the transaction to move the liquidity to another chain)and Multi-sig instead of Routers, and one of the clearest case is Ronin Bridge
where the bridge got hacked because the seed phase of Node Validator leaked. In the case of Ronin Bridge, there are 5 validators out of 9 got hacked, so hackers transfer the money our of the bridge about $600 Millions. 
Another case is Harmony Bridge where they also use Multi-sig and got hack for about $100 Millions.
Therefore, using Routers instead of Node Validator is one of the most efficiency and security that users can trust.
